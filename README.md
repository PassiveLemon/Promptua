# Promptua
> ðŸ“¡ A customizable prompt "engine" for Hilbish.

Promptua is a custom prompt builder/engine for Hilbish. It allows you to easily
create good looking prompts. For its use, it takes inspiration from
[oh-my-posh](https://ohmyposh.dev/) and Galaxyline for Neovim.

# Install
> Promptua requires Hilbish v2.0+

Clone to a Hilbish library directory:

```
git clone --depth 1 https://github.com/TorchedSammy/Promptua ~/.local/share/hilbish/libs/promptua
```

# Usage
To make a Promptua prompt, you have to make a proper theme.
A theme is a table of [segments](#segments).

## Example
```lua
local promptua = require 'promptua'

local theme = {{
	provider = 'dir.path',
	style = 'blue',
},
{
	provider = 'prompt.icon',
	style = 'green'
}}

promptua.setTheme(theme)
promptua.init()
```

## Segments
A segment is a table which has at least a `provider` key, which shows the info in the segment.
It can consist of the following keys:

```lua
{
	provider = '',
	separator = ' ',
	condition = function() end,
	icon = '',
	style = '',
	format = '@style@icon@info'
}
```

The `provider` can be a function or string. If it is a string, it will get a premade
provider function which matches.

`condition` is a function which will determine whether to show the segment in the prompt.
If it returns false, the provider will not be run and the segment will be skipped,

`style` is the color or general style of the info in the segment.
It is space separated. The following styles are available:

- Colors: black, red, green, blue, yellow, magenta, cyan, white.
There are bright variants, which are prefixed with `bright-`, like `bright-red`.
For background colors, there is a suffix of `-bg`, like `green-bg`.
These can be combined, for example with `bright-blue-bg`.
- Modifiers: dim, italic, underline, invert.

### Premade Providers
- `dir.path` - Path of current directory
- `git.branch` - Git branch
- `git.dirty` - Icon if local git has unpushed changes
- `prompt.icon` - Main prompt icon
- `prompt.failSuccess` - Prompt icon based on exit code of command
- `command.execTime` - Time it took to run a command (hidden if 0s)
- `user.name` - Username
- `user.hostname` - Hostname of machine

## Config
If needed, you can change the default separator or format for segments,
or have configuration for certain providers via the config.

Promptua has a default which looks like:
	
```lua
{
	format = '@style@icon@text',
	separator = ' '
}
```
